I have included some factorization programs. You may want to play around with different factorizations if you wish.
While the programs are not well documented, you shouldn't have any problems figuring them out. A few things

1. Not all factorizations are present as I didn't save all the files but I will add them whenever I get around to factorizing more wavelets (coifs and cdfs etc). Factorization principles are the same so you may want to factorize some new wavelets on your own.

2. Factorizations are non-unique so please feel free to modify these example files. If you want to use the new factorizations, you will have to enter them manually in the lift.h file.

3. Most sym wavelets can be factored identically to the db wavelets. You can use the corresponding db program to find the sym factorization.

4. The factorization scheme is wholly based on Sweldens/Daubechies paper so please read the paper for more information.
